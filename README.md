# AppleTree
Optimize online returns with AppleTree. AppleTree is a mobile application providing return advisory. Users input product information, whereby the application will sort through possible return streams. Streams will be evaluated based on sustainability (distance from the user) and return amount. One option from either stream will be highlighted as the most sustainable route and the other will maximize the product return amount. The user can choose either option and carry it forward, outside of the scope of the application. The apple tree depicted in the application will grow every return that the user chooses to take the sustainable option. After 5 returns (5 growth stages), the tree will mature, allowing the user to have a $10 cash-back option.
